# MultiversX blockchain transaction scenarios

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/multiversx-chain-scenario-format)](https://crates.io/crates/multiversx-chain-scenario-format)

The blockchain scenario format can model transaction, as they happen on the real blockchain, or a model of it.

Both of them are detailed under this specification: https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/scenario-reference/overview

This crate only deals with the format, not with its semantics or execution. It should not depend on any other of the framework crates.
